## 🎯 Core Concept

The **Anonymous Court Investigation System** revolutionizes judicial proceedings by combining blockchain transparency with cryptographic privacy. Using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, the system enables:

### Privacy-First Judicial Operations
- **Encrypted Evidence Submission**: All evidence is encrypted on-chain, preserving confidentiality while maintaining verifiability
- **Anonymous Witness Testimonies**: Witnesses can submit testimonies without revealing their identity
- **Confidential Investigations**: Case details remain encrypted throughout the investigation process
- **Secure Verdict Computation**: Judicial decisions are made on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information

### Key Features
- 🔐 **FHE-Powered Privacy**: Compute on encrypted judicial data without decryption
- ⚖️ **Transparent Accountability**: All actions recorded immutably on blockchain
- 🕵️ **Anonymous Participation**: Protect witness and investigator identities
- 🛡️ **Role-Based Access Control**: Investigators, judges, and administrators with distinct permissions
- 📊 **Confidentiality Levels**: Granular control over evidence sensitivity (1-100 scale)
- 🔍 **Verifiable Evidence Chain**: Cryptographic proof of evidence authenticity

## 🏛️ System Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

#### Access Control
- **Administrator**: Contract owner with full system management rights
- **Authorized Investigators**: Can start investigations, submit evidence, and manage participants
- **Authorized Judges**: Can review evidence, submit verdicts, and complete investigations
- **Authorized Participants**: Case-specific access to confidential information

#### Investigation Lifecycle
1. **Initiation**: Investigator starts a new investigation with encrypted case ID
2. **Evidence Collection**: Submit encrypted evidence with type classification and confidentiality level
3. **Witness Testimonies**: Anonymous witnesses submit encrypted testimonies with credibility scores
4. **Judicial Review**: Judges examine encrypted evidence and submit verdicts
5. **Completion**: Investigation concludes with final verdict recorded on-chain
6. **Archival**: Completed investigations archived for historical record

#### Evidence Types
- **Document**: Legal documents, contracts, written statements
- **Testimony**: Verbal statements from witnesses or experts
- **Physical**: Material evidence descriptions and metadata
- **Digital**: Electronic evidence, logs, communications

#### Verdict Options
- **Not Guilty**: Insufficient evidence of wrongdoing
- **Guilty**: Evidence substantiates allegations
- **Insufficient Evidence**: Unable to reach definitive conclusion
